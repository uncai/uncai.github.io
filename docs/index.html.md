We're a group of students at the University of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill who are interested in machine learning and artificial intelligence.
We meet every week to discuss algorithms and datasets, and build
projects. We also host a weekly reading group, where we discuss a paper
from the ML community. We're always looking for new members, so feel
free to join us!

## Upcoming Events

Initial meeting for the semester, where we'll discuss our plans for the
semester and what we're interested in working on.

A first resource is our article on [Developer Tools for Machine
Learning](dev-tools-ml).
