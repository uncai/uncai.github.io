title: Carolina ML

We're a group of students at the University of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill who are interested in machine learning and artificial intelligence.
We meet every week to discuss algorithms and datasets, and build
projects. We also host a weekly reading group, where we discuss a paper
from the ML community. We're always looking for new members, so feel
free to join us!

## Upcoming Events

**January 24, 2023: Initial meeting** for the semester, where we'll
discuss our plans for the semester and what we're interested in working
on.

A good first resource is our article on [Developer Tools for Machine
Learning](machine-learning-developer-tools).

## Principles

-   **Using the best resources** for learning, whether that's a blog
    post, a book, a paper, or even a YouTube video.
-   **Learning together:** None of us are experts, so we learn together.
    We're all here to help each other.
-   **Ambitious goals and projects:** Even if we don't finish a project,
    we'll learn a lot along the way.
-   **Inclusivity:** We are open to all students at UNC, regardless of
    major or experience level.
-   **Transparency:** We will be as transparent as possible about our
    plans and progress. We also encourage feedback and criticism.
