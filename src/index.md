title: UNC Artificial Intelligence Club
---

We're a group of students at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who are interested in machine learning and artificial intelligence. We meet every week to discuss algorithms and datasets, and build projects. We also host a weekly reading group, where we discuss a paper from the ML community. We're always looking for new members, so feel free to join us!

## Upcoming Events

**February 6, 2023 @ 6pm: Building a neural network** Check out the "Great Posts" section of our [Resources](resources) page if you want a head start in learning about neural networks. We'll be building a neural network from scratch, and then using it to classify images.

## Past events

**January 30, 2023 @ 6pm: Initial meeting** We introduced the club and discussed plans for the semester. We built multiple machine learning models and compared their outputs, while only using a few lines of code â€“ through the magic of AutoML! We also discussed how neural networks work. Here's the [slides, code, and resources](first-meeting).

You can check out our [Resources](resources) page or our article on [Developer Tools for Machine Learning](machine-learning-developer-tools).

## Principles

- **Using the best resources** for learning, whether that's a blog post, a book, a paper, or even a YouTube video.
- **Learning together:** None of us are experts, so we learn together. We're all here to help each other.
- **Ambitious goals and projects:** Even if we don't finish a project, we'll learn a lot along the way.
- **Inclusivity:** We are open to all students at UNC, regardless of major or experience level.
