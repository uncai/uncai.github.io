title: Carolina ML
---

We're a group of students at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who are interested in machine learning and artificial intelligence. We meet every week to discuss algorithms and datasets, and build projects. We also host a weekly reading group, where we discuss a paper from the ML community. We're always looking for new members, so feel free to join us!

## Upcoming Events

Initial meeting for the semester, where we'll discuss our plans for the semester and what we're interested in working on.
