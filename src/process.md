title: Our Process
---

We have a few steps to ensure our group hosts high-quality events. Each week, we'll:

1. Publish a page for the week's topic, with links to papers, blog posts, and other resources that we'll reference in our presentation/group project building. We'll also post the slides for the presentation and the code for the project there.
2. Publish our event overview in HeelLife
3. Make sure our website has the event listed in Upcoming Events
4. Send an email to our mailing list with the topic overview the day before the event.
