# UNC ML Club

We're a group of students at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who are interested in machine learning and artificial intelligence. We meet every week to discuss algorithms and datasets, and build projects. We also host a weekly reading group, where we discuss a paper from the ML community. We're always looking for new members, so feel free to join us!

## Principles

- **Using the best resources** for learning, whether that's a blog post, a book, a paper, or even a YouTube video.
- **Learning together:** None of us are experts, so we learn together. We're all here to help each other.
- **Ambitious goals and projects:** Even if we don't finish a project, we'll learn a lot along the way.
- **Inclusivity:** We are open to all students at UNC, regardless of major or experience level. 
- **Transparency:** We will be as transparent as possible about our plans and progress. We also encourage feedback and criticism.
